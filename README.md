# Learn EVM with JavaScript  

Welcome to the **"Learn EVM with JavaScript"** repository! This course is designed for web developers who want to understand the core concepts behind the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** by building a **simplified EVM using JavaScript**.

### üß† **Prerequisites**
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript  
- Familiarity with Node.js (e.g., installing packages with npm)  
- Optional: Some understanding of blockchain concepts

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-evm-with-js.git
cd learn-evm-with-js 
``` 

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
 npm install
```

### 3. Run the EVM
```bash
node index.js
```

### **üíª How the EVM Works (Simplified)**
- The Stack: Used for intermediate calculations.
- Memory: Temporary storage during execution.
- Persistent Storage: Stores data between executions.
- Instruction Set: Decodes and executes bytecode step-by-step.
- Gas Management: Ensures each operation has a cost, mimicking the behavior of the real EVM.

### **üõ† How to Use the EVM**
-You can modify the index.js file to execute your own bytecode. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```bash
javascript
Copy code
const bytecode = [
  0x02, 10,   // PUSH 10
  0x02, 20,   // PUSH 20
  0x01,       // ADD
  0x02, 0,    // PUSH 0 (storage key)
  0x03        // STORE (store result at key 0)
];
```
-This bytecode will:

Push 10 and 20 to the stack.
Add them (result = 30).
Store the result at key 0 in storage.
